    - "When joining events virtually, make sure you are logged into zoom with your UNCC account if it's a GWC-specific event. 
      Some events may note that they are open to the public, in which case a UNCC account is not required. However, 
      most events are for GWC members or UNC Charlotte students. You can learn more about using your UNCC account with zoom [here](https://spaces.uncc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=82969679). 
      For more on using zoom in general, see [here](https://spaces.charlotte.edu/display/FAQ/General+Zoom+Information)."

    points : 
    - "When joining events in-person, make sure you have registered (if required for that particular event) and are 
      following all COVID-19 protocols. Safety is a priority at our events, and this means most in-person events will have a 
      limited number of spaces and require registration to attend. For events where this is the case, it will be noted in the announcement 
      for the event on here, our weekly newsletter, and on social media. If it is a hybrid event, in-person attendance will require registration, 
      while virtual attendance will not."
