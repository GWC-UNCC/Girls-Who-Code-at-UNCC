faqs:
- question: "What are the requirements for membership?"
  answer: The only requirements for joining GWC are that you are a UNC Charlotte student (grad or undergrad) and support women in stem!

  answer: We hold elections each spring for all E-Board positions. Keep a lookout for announcements of these elections, and you can apply for any position you're interested in!

Requirements, positions, and duties may change, so be sure to check the information in the current election's announcements or forms.
