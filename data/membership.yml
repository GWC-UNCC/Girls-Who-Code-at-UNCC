        **Surveys:** Each semester, we send our Membership Surveys to see what everyone's schedule is like and whether or not you plan to be an active member that semester. A response is required for these to stay on our Active Members list. The responses we receive help us create our event schedule for that semester.

        That's pretty much it! Any other updates will be communicated on our social media accounts, Discord, or newsletter. We hope you'll join us!
