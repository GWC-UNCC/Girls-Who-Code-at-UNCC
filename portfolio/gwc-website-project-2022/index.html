Now, with the help of our Spring 2022 Web Team, we finally reached our initial launch!</p><p>Please note that the following are still being worked on: mobile responsiveness, event recaps, cleaning up and documenting the code.

I am so grateful for the Web Team coming together this semester and getting this accomplished. 💜<br><br>This has been a project in the works for a while (as most personal projects are when you are working and going to school).</p><p><strong>Fall 2020</strong><br>I created the initial prototype with Wix (before I knew how to use any prototyping tools), and it was selected as the winner of GWC&rsquo;s Prototype Showcase! &ldquo;Phoebe&rdquo;, the &ldquo;terminal chatbot&rdquo; was quite ambitious, but I thought this would be a cool addition someday.<br>Initial Prototype: <a href=https://lnkd.in/ggrznRs6>https://lnkd.in/ggrznRs6</a><br><br><strong>Spring - Fall 2021</strong><br>I began creating and teaching workshops to help everyone (including myself) get acquainted with GitHub, VS Code, Hugo, HTML, CSS, and more throughout the year. We also decided on the Hugo theme we would use to avoid having to build this site from scratch.<br>GWC Workshops: <a href=https://lnkd.in/gvn2JmsC>https://lnkd.in/gvn2JmsC</a><br><br><strong>August 2021</strong><br>I created a temporary single-page site for GWC to use.<br>Initial Website: <a href=https://lnkd.in/gyef8b_Q>https://lnkd.in/gyef8b_Q</a><br><br><strong>January 2022</strong><br><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAC36mwMBhfVmxDLwVIsChNrdQ9dGce7anmY>Zaina Shawar</a> and I designed a new prototype to adapt the old one to the chosen Hugo theme (in hopes of making the development process easier for everyone). This time, we used Figma, both learning as we went and troubleshooting together.<br>Hugo Theme: <a href=https://lnkd.in/gHvx_kVq>https://lnkd.in/gHvx_kVq</a><br>Figma Prototype: <a href=https://lnkd.in/gBh92jpi>https://lnkd.in/gBh92jpi</a><br><br>Once the prototype was ready, I worked on our Web Team Guide and we started forming the team of women you see below.<br>Web Team Guide: <a href=https://lnkd.in/gDn5JNH4>https://lnkd.in/gDn5JNH4</a><br><br><strong>May 2022</strong><br>A few months later and we can officially say our new website is LIVE! 🎉<br><br>Like the original post said, &ldquo;This project will definitely be a work in progress as we continue to improve and enhance it with those who come behind us, and we look forward to seeing it grow!&rdquo; There are some bugs to fix and code cleanup/documentation to do before I pass it on, but I am so proud of this first big step and getting to leave behind a project that future GWC members can contribute to!<br><br>Thank you to <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/girls-who-code-at-unc-charlotte/>Girls Who Code at UNC Charlotte</a> for trusting me to lead this project.
