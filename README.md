# Girls-Who-Code-at-UNCC
This is the official website for Girls Who Code at UNC Charlotte!

<!-- **This is how to clone this repo (because it has submodules)**

[Instructions](https://github.com/GWC-UNCC/Git-Intro/tree/main/03-hugo_specific#clone-recursively)

We will be developing our site with a Hugo theme and working to adapt it to the prototype from our showcase last semester.
You can check out that prototype [here](https://aharmo231.wixsite.com/gwc-uncc).
We are hoping to also implement an interactive component resembling a terminal as seen in the demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrpGN6BQHX0&list=PLdKJve2oLA7YT2VgHbxNQu0TtggwQOIWG&index=2).
