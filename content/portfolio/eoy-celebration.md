Join us Monday, May 2nd! ðŸŽ‰

Join @girlswhocode_uncc and @acmw_uncc Monday, May 2nd at 6:00pm for our combined End of Year Celebration and LAST EVENT of the semester!

This will take place at Optimist Hall in Charlotte where you can grab food, drinks, dessert, etc. and hangout with other GWC and ACMW members. We will be leaving from the Website Launch party at the tables behind the Student Union (depending on the time the Launch Party ends, we may get to Optimist Hall between 6 and 6:30pm).

If you need transportation, make sure to meet us at the Launch Party. From there you can join others for either option below:
ðŸšˆ Take the Light Rail
ðŸš˜ Carpool with Someone

Hope to see you there!
