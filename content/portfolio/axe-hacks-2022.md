What a week! ðŸŽ‰

Thank you all for making our VERY FIRST Axe Hacks so special! We had so much fun getting to know our Hackers and Mentors throughout the week, playing games, learning new tools and languages, and more.

Congratulations to all of those who participated in the hackathon, and to all those who submitted and had winning projects! We are so proud of all of the hackers, many first-timers, who teamed up and created something new together. Check out the project submissions on our [Devpost Project Gallery](https://lnkd.in/db5SMS2G)!
