### Team Positions
Our Web Team had 4 different positions available: Developer, Analyst, Archivist, and Trainee. For clarity, we have broken the role descriptions down below:

##### **Developers** | Responsible for editing and contributing to the website’s code
aka “Coders” who edited the current template code to match our Figma design and should have good documentation of their code.


##### **Analysts** | Responsible for raising, organizing, and tracking issues
aka “Reviewers” who could submit bug reports, feature requests, etc. Reviewers used our Figma design to determine if anything is missing or needs improvement.

##### **Archivists** | Responsible for keeping the repo and code easy to understand and maintain
aka “Documenters” who should add comments to code, work with Markdown files, document our team’s workflow and organization, and add ideas to help keep the repo maintainable and scalable.

##### **Trainees** | Just want to be included to watch and learn
aka “Observers” who wanted to come watch and work on the learning materials without officially being on the team.

### Our Story
This project has been a labor of love of our Team Lead, [Ashley Harmon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashharmon/), since her [initial prototype](https://youtu.be/6yToLcz0ufo) creation in 2020 and initial [single-page site](https://gwc-uncc.github.io/myportfolio/) in 2021. Together, Ashley and [Zaina Shawar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaina-shawar/) created a [new prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/YcMIVm9QH4AwPdtsDZqeQW/GWC-Website-Prototype?node-id=314%3A1042&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=238%3A733&starting-point-node-id=314%3A1293) adapted from a [Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/roxo-hugo/). Now, with the help of our Spring 2022 Web Team, we finally reached our initial launch!

Please note that the following are still being worked on: mobile responsiveness, event recaps, cleaning up and documenting the code. You can check out our [Web Team Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sxgaEG-Hd6xzkNaAmkmxFyy-j7IfFRTG25rmfYCoOFg/edit#) for more information on, and resources related to, our project.

<!-- ##### Fall 2020 
Girls Who Code at UNCC needed a website, and we had a Prototype Showcase where we would build a website based on the winning prototype in Fall 2020.

##### Spring 2021
In 2021, we began learning to use VS Code, GitHub, and a Hugo template (so we didn’t have to build from scratch). We also learned to use Figma to document our design plan.

##### Fall 2021
In

##### Spring 2022 
In the Spring of 2022, we officially dove into the development process! -->
