### Team Positions

Our Web Team had 4 different positions available: Developer, Analyst, Archivist, and Trainee. For clarity, we have broken the role descriptions down below:

##### **Developers** | Responsible for editing and contributing to the website’s code

aka “Coders” who edited the current template code to match our Figma design and should have good documentation of their code.

##### **Analysts** | Responsible for raising, organizing, and tracking issues

aka “Reviewers” who could submit bug reports, feature requests, etc. Reviewers used our Figma design to determine if anything is missing or needs improvement.

##### **Archivists** | Responsible for keeping the repo and code easy to understand and maintain

aka “Documenters” who should add comments to code, work with Markdown files, document our team’s workflow and organization, and add ideas to help keep the repo maintainable and scalable.

##### **Trainees** | Just want to be included to watch and learn

aka “Observers” who wanted to come watch and work on the learning materials without officially being on the team.

### Our Story

This project has been a labor of love of our Team Lead, [Ashley Harmon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashharmon/), since her [initial prototype](https://youtu.be/6yToLcz0ufo) creation in 2020 and initial [single-page site](https://gwc-uncc.github.io/myportfolio/) in 2021. Together, Ashley and [Zaina Shawar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaina-shawar/) created a [new prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/YcMIVm9QH4AwPdtsDZqeQW/GWC-Website-Prototype?node-id=314%3A1042&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=238%3A733&starting-point-node-id=314%3A1293) adapted from a [Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/roxo-hugo/). Now, with the help of our Spring 2022 Web Team, we finally reached our initial launch!

Please note that the following are still being worked on: mobile responsiveness, event recaps, cleaning up and documenting the code. You can check out our [Web Team Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sxgaEG-Hd6xzkNaAmkmxFyy-j7IfFRTG25rmfYCoOFg/edit#) for more information on, and resources related to, our project.

Here is a message from Ashley Harmon on the process, timeline, and teamwork:

> I cannot say enough about how happy I am that we have launched our new website! I am so grateful for the Web Team coming together this semester and getting this accomplished. 💜\
> \
> This has been a project in the works for a while (as most personal projects are when you are working and going to school).
>
> **Fall 2020**\
> I created the initial prototype with Wix (before I knew how to use any prototyping tools), and it was selected as the winner of GWC's Prototype Showcase! "Phoebe", the "terminal chatbot" was quite ambitious, but I thought this would be a cool addition someday.\
> Initial Prototype: <https://lnkd.in/ggrznRs6>\
> \
> **Spring - Fall 2021**\
> I began creating and teaching workshops to help everyone (including myself) get acquainted with GitHub, VS Code, Hugo, HTML, CSS, and more throughout the year. We also decided on the Hugo theme we would use to avoid having to build this site from scratch.\
> GWC Workshops: <https://lnkd.in/gvn2JmsC>\
> \
> **August 2021**\
> I created a temporary single-page site for GWC to use.\
> Initial Website: <https://lnkd.in/gyef8b_Q>\
> \
> **January 2022**\
> [Zaina Shawar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAC36mwMBhfVmxDLwVIsChNrdQ9dGce7anmY) and I designed a new prototype to adapt the old one to the chosen Hugo theme (in hopes of making the development process easier for everyone). This time, we used Figma, both learning as we went and troubleshooting together.\
> Hugo Theme: <https://lnkd.in/gHvx_kVq>\
> Figma Prototype: <https://lnkd.in/gBh92jpi>\
> \
> Once the prototype was ready, I worked on our Web Team Guide and we started forming the team of women you see below.\
> Web Team Guide: <https://lnkd.in/gDn5JNH4>\
> \
> **May 2022**\
> A few months later and we can officially say our new website is LIVE! 🎉\
> \
> Like the original post said, "This project will definitely be a work in progress as we continue to improve and enhance it with those who come behind us, and we look forward to seeing it grow!" There are some bugs to fix and code cleanup/documentation to do before I pass it on, but I am so proud of this first big step and getting to leave behind a project that future GWC members can contribute to!\

> Thank you to [Girls Who Code at UNC Charlotte](https://www.linkedin.com/company/girls-who-code-at-unc-charlotte/) for trusting me to lead this project.

> \
> I also want to say thank you to our team's Advisor and Outside Collaborator, [Alex Rodriguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABHmz2wB373NcawRKqsnoVsAiiMayv_7ZfU), for all of his help with some of the more difficult aspects of development, working with Hugo, and setting up our deployment.

Congrats and thank you again to the Web Team for all your hard work! We look forward to future Web Teams and seeing this site grow with this awesome organization.
