### Our Story
This project has been a labor of love of our Team Lead, Ashley Harmon, since her initial prototype creation in 2020 and initial single-page site in 2021. And with the help of our Spring 2022 Web Team, it has finally come into fruition for it's initial launch!

##### Fall 2020 
Girls Who Code at UNCC needed a website, and we had a Prototype Showcase where we would build a website based on the winning prototype in Fall 2020.

##### Spring 2021
In 2021, we began learning to use VS Code, GitHub, and a Hugo template (so we didnâ€™t have to build from scratch). We also learned to use Figma to document our design plan.

##### Fall 2021
