This was our first Fall kickoff event where all members were provided supplies to create unique tech bracelets. Along with the usual supplies to create this cool accessory. They were also able to convert a message into a code format that would be resembled by the bracelet charms. Do you want to convert your own message? Try this website [CodeBeautify](https://codebeautify.org/)! It was a very fun social event and definitely an event we see ourselves doing again in the future.
