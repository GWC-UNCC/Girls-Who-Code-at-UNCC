![Launch Party](../../images/projects/LaunchParty.png)


We're launching Monday, May 2nd! 🎉🎉

Join the GWC Web Team to celebrate the launch of our new website at 5pm at the tables behind the Student Union! 👩‍💻

We will officially swap our current website for the new one our Web Team has been developing this semester, and our team members will receive a certificate for their role and hours on the team.

Come checkout the website, congratulate our team members, and hangout with some music, drinks, and snacks! Afterwards, we will be heading to Optimist Hall in Charlotte for our EOY Celebration together.
