We had so much fun at our Launch Party! ðŸŽ‰\
\
Thank you to everyone who joined us in celebrating our new website launch and congratulating our Web Team members. We had so much fun getting to give each of these members their Web Team certificates and getting to countdown the launch!

We want to give a special shoutout to the Web Team for working on this website this semester: Ashley Harmon, Zaina Shawar, Michelle Camacho, Dene Logan, Mariam Conde, Liyu Tenaw! We are so proud of everyone stretching themselves this semester and learning to use different languages and tools to build this site together.\
\
We also want to give a special shoutout to the Web Team Advisor and Outside Collaborator, Alex Rodriguez! Thank you for helping us with a multitude of things like learning how to use Hugo shortcodes, setting up our repo to deploy the website with GitHub pages, and helping with the more complicated development pieces.Â \
