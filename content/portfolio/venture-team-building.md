What a fun outdoor bonding experience! ☀️

We want to give a huge shoutout to [Kaitlyn Gosline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlyn-g-434256116/) for organizing this event with Venture Outdoor Leadership, and a huge thank you to all those who joined us on Friday!

We had such a great time getting to know you all and hanging out in person! We were so in the moment, we didn’t even grab pics. 💕
