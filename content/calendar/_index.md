      Check out our events calendar below! Some events will be open to the
      public, UNCC students, or specifically for GWC Members. Unless noted
      otherwise in the event description, Girls Who Code events are open to all
      UNCC students. Events that are specifically for GWC members or are open to
      the public will state this in the event description. See more on joining
      [virtual](#virtual-events) and [in-person events](#in-person-events) and

      When joining events virtually, make sure you are logged into zoom with
      your UNCC account if it's a GWC-specific event.  Some events may note that
      they are open to the public, in which case a UNCC account is not required.
      However,  most events are for GWC members or UNC Charlotte students. You
      can learn more about using your UNCC account with zoom
      [here](https://spaces.uncc.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=82969679).  For
      more on using zoom in general, see
      [here](https://spaces.charlotte.edu/display/FAQ/General+Zoom+Information).

      When joining events in-person, make sure you have registered (if required
      for that particular event) and are  following all COVID-19 protocols.
      Safety is a priority at our events, and this means most in-person events
      will have a  limited number of spaces and require registration to attend.
      For events where this is the case, it will be noted in the
      announcement  for the event on here, our weekly newsletter, and on social
      media. If it is a hybrid event, in-person attendance will require
      registration,  while virtual attendance will not.
