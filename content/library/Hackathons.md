A hackathon is essentially a short period of time to build a project, typically with a team. These projects, or 'hacks,' are usually created to offer a solution to some type of problem. These 'problems' often times are used as Prize Categories on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/). You can check out our very first hackathon that GWC and ACMW hosted together [here](https://bit.ly/axe-hacks)!
