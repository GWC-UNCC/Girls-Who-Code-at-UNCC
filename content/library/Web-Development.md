Web development is such a great topic to explore nowadays, for everything from building your own portfolio to creating websites or webapps for businesses, clubs, games, etc.! GWC has chosted several workshops involving web development to build online portfolios, and we had our very own Web Team to build this website! You can check out our past event materials [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fUOufYgRbcGCmlwe0PDt1L7SaFI-rOlK-KjRlsTU5cs/edit?usp=sharing), and you can read more about our Web Team and this website project [here](../../portfolio/gwc-website-project/).
