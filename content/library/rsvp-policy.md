# Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all of our members abide by their agreement to attend our events that are funded and supply-based. Extensive planning goes into every event(s) we make each school year and we are making this policy mandatory for ALL MEMBERS to follow so that all events that are grant funded or partnered with local/national companies are not wasted. Our e-board strives to provide fun and professional events to everyone so please follow these rules in return. Thank you!

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Expectations

A requirement as an RSVP attendee for our events you are promising to attend the event that you have RSVP’d for. In the event of last-minute changes or changes, you need to change your RSVP status **at least 24 hours before the event(s)**.

# Rules

In the event that you are a NO-SHOW at the event(s) you RSVP for, the following warnings will be placed: 

## Warning 1

If you RSVP to an event that is either funded or supply-based(free food is being provided or materials are being provided) and you are a NO-SHOW for that event. You will be sent a reminder to update your RSVP at a respectable time for funded events and will be sent directly to this policy to review.



## Warning 2

If you RSVP to a 2nd event that is either funded or supply-based(free food is being provided or materials are being provided) and you are a NO-SHOW for that event. You CAN NOT attend another funded or supply-based event for the rest of the current semester. But you are free to RSVP or attend the non-funded events we hold. Also, you will have another chance to RSVP for these funded events again in the next semester.
