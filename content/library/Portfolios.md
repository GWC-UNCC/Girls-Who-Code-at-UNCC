A portfolio is a compilation of things that show your previous work, projects, skills, etc. It helps you go beyond just listing your work history by showing things like specific pieces of work you have created. Nowadays, most portfolios are online websites. But you don't even need to know how to code to build one, as there are many sites that have a drag and drop interface for you to create and host your own website!

If you are interested in learning to build one yourself with code, there are also lots of templates out there where you don't have to build it from scratch. GWC has hosted a couple workshops on building portfolios now, and those resources can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fUOufYgRbcGCmlwe0PDt1L7SaFI-rOlK-KjRlsTU5cs/edit?usp=sharing).
