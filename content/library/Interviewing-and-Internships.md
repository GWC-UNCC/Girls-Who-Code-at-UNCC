Interviews and internships are an important part of everyone's career journeys. Girls Who Code has had a few events on these topics like how to prepare and panels on other's interviewing or internship experiences. We have also had companies come and speak about their processes and opportunities for college students. You can find some of our recordings and materials [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fUOufYgRbcGCmlwe0PDt1L7SaFI-rOlK-KjRlsTU5cs/edit?usp=sharing)!
